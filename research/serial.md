## Serial interface
There seams to be two different serial interfaces on the robot. One you can connect via the usb port where the dustbin resides, and blocks. The other one with jumper wires or soldering. Here you can connect via a TTY adapter. 

### On different robots

**NOTE: Verified robots are D3, D5, D7. It should be the same for the other D4 and D6**

#### D3/D4
I suspect that the D4 looks the same as the D3, because from some research the only difference was their battery and maybe filter.

#### D5/D6
Inside looks practically identical to D3. It has the extra sidebrush motor that is missing in the D3. [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqgD7zuyLuA) 

![d5](./pics/other-robots/d5.png)
#### D7
Looks once again practically identical to the D3. It has the extra sidebrush motor and the status leds are from a separate board. [source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i-CzfMNqBFw)

### Pinout for D3
But I am very very certain it is the same for D3/D4/D5/D6/D7.

The pinout looks like this:

(The pin labled 3.3V? is a 3.3V pin)

#### D70/D75/D80/D85
These use a compleatly different pcb and they have the serial debug strips on the left side of the chassi.

I suspect the D70 and D75 look the same.

The pinout for these should be like this:

### Connecting
Connecting to a USB TTY Adapter you only need to connect ground and RX to the robot TX to the output, to be able to send commands, you connect the TX to the robot RX. 

Connecting to the serial interface with screen:
`screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200`

Shows some logs of the robot starting up, including a boot menu if the robot was fully shut down and you press enter twice.

The serial interface on the `3.2.0` version: (the `4.5.3` version I will add later)
```
ARCHES Board (04.0x90c973a5)
Press enter twice within the next 2 seconds for boot menu
Enter Key Detected!

**Commands:

Press 'M' to load IFS from main image flash partition
Press 'F' to load IFS from factory image flash partition
Press 'X' for serial download, using XModem-1k
Press '1' for XModem-1k download at 1Mb/s
Press '3' for XModem-1k download at 3Mb/s
Press 'S' to scan existing memory without download

If it just was sleeping or not fullt shut down.

```

Then it starts up, you can now enter commands! The commands listed by the `Help` command are as follows:
```
Help - Without any argument, this prints a list of all possible cmds.
With a command name, it prints the help for that particular command
Clean - Starts a cleaning by simulating press of start button.
ClearFiles - Erases Black Box, and other Logs
DiagTest - Executes different test modes. Once set, press Start button to engage. (Test modes are mutually exclusive.)
GenerateRobotLinkCode - Generate and send robot linking code to server.
GetConfiguredWifiNetworks - Get the list of configured wifi networks.
GetRobotLinkCode - Get the robot linking code
CancelRobotLink - Cancel link request.
SetNTPTime - Set system time using the NTP servers (WIFI must be up for this to work)
GetAccel - Get the Accelerometer readings.
GetAnalogSensors - Get the A2D readings for the analog sensors.
GetButtons - Get the state of the UI Buttons.
GetCalInfo - Prints out the cal info from the System Control Block.
GetCharger - Get the diagnostic data for the charging system.
GetDigitalSensors - Get the state of the digital sensors.
GetErr - Get Error Message.
GetLDSScan - Get scan packet from LDS.
GetMotors - Get the diagnostic data for the motors.

TestMode - Sets TestMode on or off. Some commands can only be run in TestMode.
Upload - Uploads new program to the robot.
```

Now the commandline is not case-sensetive and it also checks if the string you written is part of a command or parameter for a command. If it is an only match it will "autocompleage" the command for you, if multiple matches then it will list what it could be. Thanks to this functionality I have discovered some commands that is not documented in the `Help` command:
```
GetActiveServices
GetLoggingType
GetState
```

Commands that was in the old programming manual but I don't know how to use:
```
GetSysLog
```

Since then I have found more [hidden commands](./hidden-commands.md)!

#### Differences I found in 3.2.0 and 4.5.3

3.2.0 has more options for `SetSystemMode`:
```
SetSystemMode - Set the operation mode of the robot. (TestMode Only)
    Shutdown - Shut down the robot. (mutually exclusive of other options)
    Hibernate - Start hibernate operation.(mutually exclusive of other options)
    Standby - Start standby operation. (mutually exclusive of other options)
    PowerCycle - Power cycles the entire system. (mutually exclusive of other options)
```

#### Logs when doing a factory reset:
