You can also use this repair without Home Assistant, however only version 1 will be supported for this route, since later versions will require a docker container with ros2 for the floormap functions.

### Step 1
I have made some prebuilt images for reccomended ESP32s, however, if you have another ESP32 that is not listed here, ask me and I will build you one!
